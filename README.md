# Dates Classification using Neural Networks

In this project I use a dataset of features of Dates (found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/date-fruit-datasets)
which describes features extracted using CV and I use this dataset to train 3 different Neural Networks with different layers and showcase
the different results measured against validation data.
